# Thera-Bank-Loan-Data-Analysis
Welcome to the sample GitHub ReadME! Use this template as an outline for your data analytics projects. Include one ReadME per repository, with each repository storing one project. Remember, it's better to have quality over quantity - having 2 stellar business-relevant projects stands out much more than 3+ mediocre projects. Feel free to make a copy of this or fork this repository and make it your own. Happy portfolio-ing :)

# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

The visualizations highlight key trends across customer demographics and their financial behaviors. First, higher education levels are associated with greater adoption of personal loans and investment products like securities and CD accounts. Second, younger, higher-income customers show a higher likelihood of taking loans and exhibit greater credit card spending, while digital engagement is a significant driverâ€”customers using online banking are more likely to adopt multiple financial products. To maximize product adoption and mitigate financial risks, the bank should focus on targeted marketing for higher-educated customers, promote online banking to boost overall engagement, and carefully manage risk among lower-income, high-spending customers.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
